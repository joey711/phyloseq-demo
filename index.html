<h2>Extended Documentation</h2>

<p>This repository hosts <strong>extended examples</strong> of <a href="http://joey711.github.com/phyloseq/">the phyloseq package</a>, created by <a href="https://people.stanford.edu/mcmurdie/">the phyloseq author</a>, but with a size and/or scope that makes them unsuitable for including among the core tutorials on <a href="http://joey711.github.com/phyloseq/">the phyloseq main page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This repository is also intended to host user-provided tutorials of their new/interesting datasets and analysis</strong>. Contributions should be in the form of a standard <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">GitHub Pull Request</a>, preferably created using <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/r_markdown">R markdown</a> with the <code>.rmd</code> source and the <code>.md</code> and <code>.html</code> output already built, as well as any necessary input data that is not otherwise open and web-facing. The pull requests can be made to either the master or <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator">gh-pages branch</a>, but most things added to the master branch will be migrated to the gh-pages by me so that it can be directly accessed by users as web content, so please consider just directing your pull requests toward the gh-pages branch. Also, I will decline or omit examples that are not reproducible. The <code>.rmd</code> source should be able to completely rebuild the examples you've shown by anyone that has downloaded the repo to their machine, with any tweaks or data-access being as transparent as possible.</p>

<hr><h2>Demo Materials</h2>

<p>This repository originally hosted material for <a href="https://secure.bioconductor.org/BioC2012/labs.php">a workshop session</a> regarding the use of <a href="http://joey711.github.com/phyloseq/">the phyloseq package</a> for microbiome census data in R. The original materials were expected to support a a 75 - 120 minute interactive workshop demonstration. Those materials are archived as <a href="https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq-demo/tree/phyloseq-demo-snapshot">a "snapshot" branch</a> for interested users, though some of the code may be slightly outdated already. The best, most-current place to start browsing extended tutorials/examples is right here from this main page.s</p>

<p>The <a href="https://secure.bioconductor.org/BioC2012/">Bioconductor Conference (BioC 2012)</a> was held on July 24-25, 2012, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center - Seattle, WA</p>
