phyloseq-demo
=============

## Extended Documentation

This repository hosts **extended examples** of [the phyloseq package](http://joey711.github.com/phyloseq/), created by [the phyloseq author](https://people.stanford.edu/mcmurdie/), but with a size and/or scope that makes them unsuitable for including among the core tutorials on [the phyloseq main page](http://joey711.github.com/phyloseq/).

**This repository is also intended to host user-provided tutorials of their new/interesting datasets and analysis**. Contributions should be in the form of a standard [GitHub Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests), preferably created using [R markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/r_markdown) with the `.rmd` source and the `.md` and `.html` output already built, as well as any necessary input data that is not otherwise open and web-facing. The pull requests can be made to either the master or [gh-pages branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator), but anything to the master branch will basically be migrated to gh-pages by me so that it can be directly accessed by users as web content.

## Demo Materials

This repository originally hosted material for [a workshop session](https://secure.bioconductor.org/BioC2012/labs.php) regarding the use of [the phyloseq package](http://joey711.github.com/phyloseq/) for microbiome census data in R. The original materials were expected to support a a 75 - 120 minute interactive workshop demonstration. Those materials are archived as [a "snapshot" branch](https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq-demo/tree/phyloseq-demo-snapshot) for interested users, though some of the code may be slightly outdated already. The best, most-current place to start browsing extended tutorials/examples is right here from this main page.s

The [Bioconductor Conference (BioC 2012)](https://secure.bioconductor.org/BioC2012/) was held on July 24-25, 2012, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center - Seattle, WA
